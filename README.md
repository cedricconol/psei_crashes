# Visualization of PSE index crashes

![](PSEi_crashes.png)

Inspired by a visualization of S&P500 crashes by u/incitatus451 on [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fjvtt5/oc_current_market_sell_off_compared_to_major_ones/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), I made one for PSE Index. Notable PSE crashes include the 1997 crash, 2008 financial crisis crash and the most recent and ongoing (as of writing) COVID-19-induced crash.

Daily PSEi historical price was downloaded from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSEI.PS/history/), full Jupyter notebook is uploaded [here](https://github.com/cedricconol/psei_crashes/blob/master/PSEi%20Crashes.ipynb).
